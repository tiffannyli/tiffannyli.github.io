            Designed by Sir Christopher Wren and located in the City of London, St. Paul's Cathedral is one of the most famous and recognizable landmark
            in London. 
            <br><br>
            I first visited St. Paul's Cathedral on July 2, 2019 when I toured around the outside of the Cathedral. It was pass visiting
            hours so my friend and I were not able to go in. It's actually very important to check opening times for the Cathedral, it closes
            at certain times for church service.

            <p class="body">The outside of the Cathedral is already breathtaking, but the interior will not disappoint. St. Paul's Cathedral is one of 
            those buildings that you really need to visit the actual site to really appreciate its beauty. I went back to visit several times
            during my study abroad in London.

            <p class="body">Bonus: If you are able to walk up couple hundreds of narrow staircases, I strongly recommend taking that 528 steps to the Golden Gallery. 
            At there, you will be able to have a bird's view eye of the City of London, including famomus landmarks 
            along River Thames.
